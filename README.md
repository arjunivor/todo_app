Currently, deploying this application to cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku requires a credit card, which I donâ€™t possess. Consequently, I'm unable to deploy to any cloud services that integrate with payment systems in India, where regulations are significantly more stringent than in the U.S.

That said, the application is fully functional with a backend built using Python and Django, while the frontend leverages Vite and React, with the API also implemented in Python.

To get started, you need to run the backend using the command `python manage.py runserver` . Ensure you're in the correct directory to avoid terminal errors. For the frontend, make sure Node.js and Vite are installed, then execute `npm run` to initiate an instance. At this point, the application is ready for testing and deployment.
