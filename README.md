# fullstack_todoapp

Unfortunately, to deploy this to a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku requires the use of a credit card, which I do not have. As a result
I am unable to deploy the app to any cloud platform that works with payment systems in india that require credit cards, as the systems
in India are much more strict/different to those abroad in the U.S. for example.

That said, the app works with a functioning backend and frontend, the backend uses Python and Django, the front end uses Vite + React and the
api is written in Python.

To use, you must first run the backend with the command python manage.py runserver. make sure you are in the correct directory when running the command otherwise any terminal you are using will give you errors. To run the frontend, make sure you have nodejs and vite installed, and run npm run to start an instance. It is now ready for testing and deployment.
